## Views

This folder will hold the views for your routes, they're html files, but can be simple text files as well. Currently there is no markdown conversion.

The Views may contain Alpine components and they will be rendered normally.

### Icons

You can use icons from almost any icon sets by the power of [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

It will only bundle the icons you use. Check out [vite-plugin-purge-icons](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-purge-icons) for more details.

#### Usage:

```html
<span class="iconify" data-icon="carbon:sun"></span>
```
