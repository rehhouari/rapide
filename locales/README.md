## i18n

This directory is to serve your locale translation files. Yaml files under this folder are loaded automatically and register with their filenames as locale code.

Check out [`alpinejs-i18n`](https://github.com/rehhouari/alpinejs-i18n) for more details.

### VS Code extension
If you are using VS Code, [`i18n Ally`](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally) is recommended to make the i18n experience better.

The exetensions settings are already included in the `.vscode` folder in the root of this project.

It will give you analytics on usage, allow you to add missing translations, preview the text online, and more.
