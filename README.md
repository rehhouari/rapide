## NOTICE:

look, i **can't** work on it now, _sadly_. it works but you need to make some changes:

* roll back to this commit: https://github.com/rehhouari/rapide/commit/05b0e513949747b0fc645e3ea65c9d4f4d12630b

it have potential, or had. it came make spinning up a web app with alpine **v2** really quick but there are some problems. i tried documeting everything but the [vite plugin](https://github.com/pinecone-router/vite-plugin-pinecone-pages) isn't documented.

I don't think anyone would bother but if you're bored feel free, I'll try to accept pull requests too, and it's MIT so you can fork all parts i made (router, i18n, vite plugin) and make a better template. good luck and sorry.

## Why

This template is heavily inspired by and based on [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu)'s [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) for Vue. I wanted to bring a similar development experience to Alpine.js and show how it can be used to make web apps as well and not just as a JQuery alternative. So I been building plugins for Alpine.js & Vite to bridge the gap that made it difficult to accomplish that.

Before I found Vitesse, I've based this on [@ryangjchandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler)'s experiment on code organization. When I saw it I felt it has potential, and I wanted to make it more accessible. hopefully I did now.
