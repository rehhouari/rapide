# Vite & Alpine.js PWA Template

> An opinionated PWA template.

For use on a project, will update with docs if it turns out good.

## [Demo](https://vite-alpine-pwa.vercel.app/)

> Based on [Alpine Experiments](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-experiments) from [Ryan Chandler](https://github.com/ryangjchandler) and [TASH](https://github.com/go4cas/tash-starter-template)!

## What is included?

-   [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev) for fast dev server & production builds.
-   [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org) for component styling.
-   [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for reactivity and component logic.
-   [Spruce](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/spruce) for application state management.
-   [Alpine Magic Helpers](https://github.com/KevinBatdorf/alpine-magic-helpers), [$clipboard](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard), [$toggle](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-toggle), [x-else](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/x-else) for additional sugar.
-   [Pinecone Router](https://github.com/pinecone-router/router) for routing.

You get the following out of the box:

-   Vite.js dev server with WindiCSS configured.
-   Central application store, using Spruce.
-   Component logic split in separate files using es6 modules.
-   Routing with Pinecone Router.
