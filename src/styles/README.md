- [`main.css`](./main.css) which is imported automatically (in `main.ts`) and processed by WindiCS
- [`markdown.css`](./markdown.css) which contain styles for markdown views & syntax highlighting
- [`nprogress.css`](./styles/nprogress.css) which allow you to customize your progress bar. i made it easier by providing css variables for you to customize.
