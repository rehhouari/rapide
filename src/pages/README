## File-based Routing

Routes will be auto-generated for html & js/ts files in this dir with the same file structure.
Check out [`vite-plugin-pinecone`](https://github.com/rehhouari/vite-plugin-pinecone) for more details.

### Naming

- Name the files the way you'd name routes in [Pinecone Router](https://github.com/pinecone-router/router#route-matching).

### Views

Views are HTML files that can also have Alpine components in them.


### Handlers

Handlers are Typescript or Javascript files that export a single default function which take `Context` as a parameter.

```ts
import type { Context } from "pinecone-router";

export default (context: Context) => {
	// do something
}
```

#### Path Aliasing

`~/` is aliased to `./src/` folder.

For example, instead of having

```ts
import { isDark } from '../../../../logic'
```

now, you can use

```ts
import { isDark } from '~/logic'
```
